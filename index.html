        <h1>BicBucStriim</h1>

<p>BicBucStriim streams books, digital books. It fills a gap in the functionality of current NAS devices that provide access to music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim fills this gap and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim was created when I bought a NAS device (Synology DS 512+) to store my media on it. NAS devices like the Synology DS typically include media servers that publish audio, video, photos, so that you can access your media from all kinds of devices (TV, smart phone, laptop ...) inside the house, which is very convenient. Unfortunately there is nothing like that for e-books. So BicBucStriim was created.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in the Apache/PHP environment provided by the NAS. It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. The application reads the Calibre data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it. </p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim is intended for in-house usage, on a NAS or a similar device without much memory and processing power. On a PC you could simply use the Content Server built into Calibre.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a possibility to publish a larger book collection, or want to publish on the Internet, then <a href="http://calibre2opds.com/">calibre2opds</a> might be interesting. It generates a static HTML catalog of a Calibre library that then can be transferred to a web server.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim is still under development. Version 0.6.1 of BicBucStriim: </p>

<ul>
<li>displays the 30 most recent titles on the index page</li>
<li>provides a listing of all books </li>
<li>provides a listing of all authors</li>
<li>provides detail pages (including download links) for authors and books</li>
<li>includes filtering/searching for books and authors</li>
<li>is bilingual, English/German</li>
<li>is ready for mobile clients (tested with Kindle, iPhone, iPad)</li>
</ul><h2>Install</h2>

<p>The easy way assumes that BicBucStriim lives right below the web root of your device and can be addressed like <code>http://&lt;your ip&gt;/bbs/</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download a installation archive from <a href="https://github.com/rvolz/BicBucStriim/downloads">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Unarchive the downloaded archive below the web server root of your NAS (e.g. "/volume1/web" on a Synology device)</li>
<li>Rename the newly created directory (e.g. BicBucStriim-0.5.0.zip) to "bbs".</li>
<li>NOTE: If you don't want to use the directory name <em>bbs</em> simply change the .htaccess file accordingly (the line "RewriteBase /bbs/")</li>
<li>Make the "logs" directory writeable for all: <code>chmod ga+w logs</code>
</li>
<li>Enter the full path to your Calibre library directory in config.php</li>
<li>BicBucStriim should now be working, start your web browser and navigate to <code>http://&lt;address of your NAS&gt;/bbs/</code>
</li>
</ul><h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apache web server with PHP 5.2+ and sqlite3 support</li>
</ul><h2>License</h2>
