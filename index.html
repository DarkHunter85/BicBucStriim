        <h1>BicBucStriim</h1>

<p>BicBucStriim streams books, digital books. It fills a gap in the functionality of current NAS devices that provide access to music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim fills this gap and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim was created when I bought a NAS device (Synology DS 512+) to store my media on it. NAS devices like the Synology DS typically include media servers that publish audio, video, photos, so that you can access your media from all kinds of devices (TV, smart phone, laptop ...) inside the house, which is very convenient. Unfortunately there is nothing like that for e-books. So BicBucStriim was created.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in the Apache/PHP environment provided by the NAS. It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. The application reads the Calibre data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it. </p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim is intended for in-house usage, on a NAS or a similar device without much memory and processing power. On a PC you could simply use the Content Server built into Calibre.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a possibility to publish a larger book collection, or want to publish on the Internet, then <a href="http://calibre2opds.com/">calibre2opds</a> might be interesting. It generates a static HTML catalog of a Calibre library that then can be transferred to a web server.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim is still under development. Version 0.7.0 of BicBucStriim: </p>

<ul>
<li>displays the 30 most recent titles on the index page</li>
<li>provides listing/filtering/searching for book titles</li>
<li>provides listing/filtering/searching for authors</li>
<li>provides listing/filtering/searching for tags</li>
<li>shows detail pages for authors and books (including download links) </li>
<li>is ready for mobile clients (tested with Kindle, iPhone, iPad)</li>
<li>offers an optional download protection for books (think "parental control")</li>
<li>is bilingual, English/German</li>

</ul>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim just displays what is stored in your Calibre library. The start page lists the 30 most recent books in your library, assuming that they are new and therefore need to be read:</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-070-index-en.png" alt="The index lists the 30 most recent books."/></p>

<p>In addition the main menu shows three ways to navigate through your library, by book title (<em>books</em>), author name (<em>authors</em>) and tag (<em>tags</em>). All three sections work in the same way, you either scroll through the listing or filter/search by entering something in the search bar at the top.</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-070-listing-en.png" alt="Navigating thorugh your library by book title"/></p>

<p>Once a book is selected, the app shows a details page with title, author information, tags and the book description. In the download section of that page there are download links for all book formats stored in the Calibre library. Click on a link and the book file will be immediately sent to your device.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The easy way assumes that BicBucStriim lives right below the web root of your device and can be addressed like <code>http://&lt;your ip&gt;/bbs/</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download a installation archive from <a href="https://github.com/rvolz/BicBucStriim/downloads">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Unarchive the downloaded archive below the web server root of your NAS (e.g. "/volume1/web" on a Synology device)</li>
<li>Rename the newly created directory (e.g. BicBucStriim-0.7.0) to "bbs".</li>
<li>Make the "logs" directory writeable for all, e.g. <code>chmod ga+w logs</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tell BicBucStriim where your Calibre library lives</h3>

<p>Configuration is easy. Just copy the file <code>config.php.template</code> to <code>config.php</code> and edit the latter with the text editor of your choice.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim needs to know where you Calibre library directory resides, the full path to the folder that contains your metadata.db and the book directories. In my case that is <code>/volume1/books/</code> so the configuration entry looks like:</p>

<p class="highlight"><span class="nv">$calibre_dir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/volume1/books&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span></p>

<p>That is all you need to do to get BicBucStriim running. Save and close the file, start your web browser and navigate to <code>http://&lt;address of your NAS&gt;/bbs/</code>. The index page should appear.</p>

<h3>Optional: Download protection</h3>

<p>BicBucStriim is a personal application and assumes that it is running in a safe environment. The emphasis is on conveniency in your home LAN, so there is not much security built in. However, for situations where <em>parental control</em>, or something like that, is necessary, we have the download protection. When activated users need a password to download book files. By default downloads are not protected.</p>

<p>To switch the download protection on, open <code>config.php</code> again and set the toggle for this feature to <code>true</code>:</p> 

<p class="highlight"><span class="nv">$glob_dl_toggle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span></p>

<p>Then enter a suitable password:</p>

<p class="highlight"><span class="nv">$glob_dl_password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;7094e7dc2feb759758884333c2f4a6bdc9a16bb2&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</p>

<p>That's it. (To turn it off again just set the toggle to <code>false</code>.) The download links will now only appear if the valid password was entered:</p>
